## Features

- **File-based version control** — track versions of specific files independently.  
- **Easy commits** — record changes with a simple commit message.  
- **Revert anytime** — roll back a single file without affecting others.  
- **Grouped snapshot** — Track multiple files with ease for collective commit and revert.
- **Simple and fast** — minimal setup, no complex repository management.

## How does it work?

`qwe` allows you to track individual files separately or bundle related files into a single, named snapshot for easy tracking and rollback.

**Group Creation:** Create a logical group (e.g., "Project X Assets," "Configuration Files") that contains multiple individual files.

**Unified Tracking:** When you take a snapshot of the group, qwe captures the current state of all files within it. This makes rolling back a set of related changes incredibly simple.
