# qwe — A Lightweight File-Level Version Control System

**qwe** (pronounced *kiwi*) is a simple yet powerful version control system that tracks **individual files**, not entire projects.  
Unlike Git, which manages repositories as a whole, qwe provides a more granular approach — perfect for quick file-level tracking, experimentation, or standalone scripts.

---

## Features

- **File-based version control** — track versions of specific files independently.  
- **Easy commits** — record changes with a simple commit message.  
- **Revert anytime** — roll back a single file without affecting others.  
- **Simple and fast** — minimal setup, no complex repository management.

---

## Installation

You can install **qwe** in two ways:

### 1️⃣ Using Go Package Manager
```bash
go install github.com/mainak55512/qwe@latest
```

Make sure your Go environment’s `GOPATH/bin` is added to your system `PATH`.

### 2️⃣ Using Prebuilt Executables
Download the prebuilt binary for your platform from the **[Releases](https://github.com/mainak55512/qwe/releases)** section of this repository and add it to your PATH.
